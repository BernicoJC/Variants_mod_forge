# Variants Forge Mod
A Minecraft forge mod that aims to add extra weapons for extra variations of each playthrough. It adds 41 functional items, including a unique mana system, and tiered weapons system similar to Terraria. It uses Forge modding API.

## Features
### General Items List
1. Dagger: A faster, but weaker, alternative to swords
2. Staff: Uses mana, shoots strong, singular projectile that deals straight forward damage, though some gimmicks exist for higher tier weapons.
3. Spellbook: Uses mana, quickly shoots weaker projectiles that deal weaker damage, but have extra gimmicks attached to the weapons.
4. Gun: An alternative for bows that have shorter range, but more damage and at times also faster.

Other than these, there are also bonus weapons not attached to any of the tiers.
